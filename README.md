Pawfect Match (Rajvi Deeraj R, Surya KP, koushik vishal )

Pawfect Match is a caring platform dedicated to connecting pets with loving homes, with a special focus on stray dogs in India. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Flask, our lightweight application stores pet information in a JSON file and delivers a smooth, interactive experience. The platform also leverages a Blue-Green Deployment strategy with Docker and Nginx to ensure zero downtime during updates, making adoption simple, reliable, and accessible for everyone. This project implements a DevOps CI/CD pipeline for a web application that helps connect stray pets with adopters, featuring automated deployment and monitoring.
